        <h3>Chapter 8</h3>
    <p>This week I enjoyed learning more about forms in JavaScript. Some of the things that jumped out to me in chapter 8 were:
        <ul>
            <li>form.submit() submits the form automatically but will not trigger the "submit" event. We can submit the form manually by employing a button or input element with a type attribute of submit or even an input element with a type attribute of image.</li>
            <li>form.reset() method will result in all the form controls reset back to their initial values specified in the HTML - reset buttons generally = poor usability.  They are too easy to click.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>focus: event occurs when element is focused on</li>
                <li>Blur: event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the element </li>
                <li>change : occurs when the user moves focus away from the element AFTER CHANGING IT</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>OOP</h3>
    <p>Object Oriented Programming : involves separating the code into objects that have properties and methods. Keeps related pieces of code encapsulated in objects that maintain state throughout the life of the program.  Objects can be reused or modified.<br>
        <strong>3 main concepts</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Encapsulation</li>
            <ul>
                <li>innerworkings kept hidden inside of the object and only the essential functionalities are exposed to the end user</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Polymorphism</li>
            <ul>
                <li>same process can be used for different objects.</li>
                <li>various objects can share the same method - but also have the ability to overrride shared methods with a more specific implementation</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Inheritance</li>
            <ul>
                <li>taking the features of one object adn the adding some new features</li>
                <li>take an object that already exists and then inherit all its properties and methods - improve functionality by adding new methods and properties</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
