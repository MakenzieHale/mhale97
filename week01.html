    <p>I took a lot from the videos in the  "Master Mobile UX" course.  The main takeaway being "whatever you're doing, do mobile first." As I watched the video I noticed that many websites have adapted to this way of thinking which has lead to many user frustrations.  It is important to remember that mobile is not a fad and it is not going away.  
        I also like learning about ways to improved mobile UX.
        1. Be there - cater to the user's needs.
        2. Be useful - give them what they came for.
        3. Be quick - smooth and seamless transitions.  

        This can be accomplished by:
        1. reducing image usage throughout the site/app.
        2. optimizing and minifying css & js files
        3. GZIP files to eliminate unnecessary data.

        Overall, this video really made me excited for what this semester holds!
