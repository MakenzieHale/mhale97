    <p>I took a lot from the videos in the  "Master Mobile UX" course.  The main takeaway being "whatever you're doing, do mobile first." As I watched the video I noticed that many websites have adapted to this way of thinking which has lead to many user frustrations.  It is important to remember that mobile is not a fad and it is not going away. <br><br>


       <strong> I also like learning about ways to improved mobile UX:</strong><br>
        1. Be there - cater to the user's needs.<br>
        2. Be useful - give them what they came for.<br>
        3. Be quick - smooth and seamless transitions.<br><br>  

        <strong>This can be accomplished by:</strong><br>
        1. reducing image usage throughout the site/app.<br>
        2. optimizing and minifying css & js files<br>
        3. GZIP files to eliminate unnecessary data.<br><br>

        Overall, this video really made me excited for what this semester holds!
